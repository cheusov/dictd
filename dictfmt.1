.SH NAME
dictfmt \- formats a DICT protocol dictionary database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BI dictfmt "  -c5|-e|-f|-h|-j|-p [options]  basename"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dictfmt
takes a file, 
.I FILE,
on stdin, and creates a dictionary database named 
.I basename.dict,
that conforms to the DICT protocol.  It also creates an index file named 
.I basename.index.  
By default, the index is sorted according to the
C locale, and only alphanumeric characters and spaces are used in
sorting, however this may be changed with the --locale and --allchars
options.  (
.IR basename  " is commonly chosen to correspond to the basename of"
.I FILE
, but this is not mandatory.)  

Unless the database is extremely small, it is
highly recommended that 
.I basename.dict
be compressed with
.I /usr/bin/dictzip 
to create 
.I basename.dict.dz.
(dictzip is included in
the 
.B dictd 
source package.)    

FILE may be in any of the several formats described by 
the format options \-c5, \-e, \-f, \-h, \-j, or \-p.  Exactly one of 
these options must be given.

Headers are prepended to the .dict file giving the URL of the site
from which the original database was obtained, the name of the
dictionary, and the date of conversion (formatting).  If the -u and/or
-s options are omitted, the value "unknown" will be included for these
values, which is undesirable for a publicly distributed database.

All text in the input file prior to the first headword is appended to
the headers in the .dict file.  All text in the input file following
a headword, up to the next headword, is copied unchanged to the .dict
file.

.SH FORMATTING OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c5 
.I
FILE 
is formatted with 
.B headwords 
preceded by 5 or more underscore characters (_) and a blank line. 
All text until the next 
.B headword 
is considered the definition.  Any leading `@'
characters are stripped out, but the file is otherwise unchanged. This
option was written to format the CIA WORLD FACTBOOK 1995.
.TP
.BI \-e 
.I
FILE 
is in html format, with the 
.B headword 
tagged as bold.  (<B>headword - </B>)
.RS
This option was written to format EASTON'S 1897 BIBLE DICTIONARY.  A
typical entry from Easton is:

<A NAME="T0000005">
.br
<B>Abagtha - </B>
.br
one of the seven eunuchs in Ahasuerus's court (Esther 1:10;
2:21).

This is converted to:
.br
Abagtha
.br
   one of the seven eunuchs in Ahasuerus's court (Esther 1:10;
2:21).

The heading "<A NAME="T0000005"> is omitted, and the 
.B headword 
`Abagtha' is indexed.

.B NOTE: 
This option should be used with caution.  It removes several html tags
(enough to format Easton properly), but not all.  The Makefile that
was originally written to format dict-easton uses sed scripts to
modify certain cross reference tags.  It may be necessary to pipe the
input file through a sed script, or hack the source of dictfmt in
order to properly format other html databases.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-f 
.I FILE 
is formatted with the 
.B headwords
starting in column 0, with the definition indented at least one space
(or tab character) on subsequent lines.  The third line starting in
column 0 is taken as the first headword, and the first two lines
starting in column 0 are treated as part of the headers.  This option
was written to format the F.O.L.D.O.C.
.TP
.BI \-h 
.I
FILE 
is formatted with the 
.B headwords
starting in column 0, followed by a comma, with the definition
continuing on the same line.  All text before the first single
character line is considered part of the headers, and lines with only
one character are omitted from the .dict file.  The first headword
is on the line following the first single character line.
.RS
This option was written to format HITCHCOCK'S  BIBLE
NAMES DICTIONARY.  The 
.B headword 
is indexed; the text of the file is not changed. 
.RE
.TP
.BI \-j 
.I
FILE 
is formatted with 
.B headwords 
starting in col 0, enclosed in colons, followed by the definition.
.RS
This option was written to format the JARGON FILE.  The colons
surrounding the 
.B headword
are removed, and the
.B headword
is indexed.  Lines beginning with '*', '=', or '-' are also removed.
All text before the first headword is included in the headers. 

.B NOTE:
Some recent versions of the JARGON FILE had three blanks inserted
before the first colon at each headword.  These must be removed before
processing with dictfmt.  (sed scripts have been used for this
purpose. ed, awk, or perl scripts are also possible.)
.RE
.TP
.BI \-p 
.I
FILE 
is formatted with `%h' in column 0, followed by a blank, followed by the 
.B headword,
optionally followed by a line containing `%d' in column 0.  The
definition starts on the following line.  The first line beginning
\'%h\' and any lines beginnning '%d' are stripped from the .dict
file, and '%h ' is stripped from in front of the headword.  All
text before the first headword is included in the headers.   
..br
This option was written to format Jay Kominek's elements database.  

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-u " url"
Specifies the URL of the site from which the raw database was obtained.
.TP
.BI \-s " name"
Specifies the name and, optionally, the version and date, of the
database.  (If this contains spaces, it must be quoted.)
.TP
.BI \-L 
display license and copyright information
.TP
.BI \-V 
display version information
.TP
.BI \-D 
output debuugging information
.TP
.BI \--help
display a help message
.TP
.BI \--locale " locale"
specifies the locale used for sorting.  if no locale is specified, the
"C" locale is used. 
.TP
.BI \--allchars
use all characters (not only alphanumeric and space) in sorting the index
.TP
.BI \--headword-separator " sep"
sets the head word separator, which allows several words to have the same
definition.  For example, if \'--headword-separator %%%' is given,
and the input file contains \'autumn%%%fall', both 'autumn' and 'fall'
will be indexed as  headwords, with the same definition.
.TP
.BI \--without-headword
head words will not be included in .dict file
.TP
.BI \--without-header
header will not be copied to DB info entry
.TP
.BI \--without-url
URL will not be copied to DB info entry
.TP
.BI \--without-time
time of creation will not be copied to DB info entry
.TP
.BI \--without-info
DB info entry will not be created.
This may be useful if 00-database-info headword
is expected from stdin (dictunformat outputs it).
